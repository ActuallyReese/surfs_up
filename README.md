## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu for the last year (2017). Doing so would help determine how successful a surf and ice cream shop might be on the island.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- The averages and max temperatures for both months are fairly similar, with June being slightly warmer

- The minimum temperature in December is eight degrees colder, which is quite a lot

- Even though December has the chance to be much colder, at least half of the temperatures are 71 F or above.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Both June and December could be successful months. The average temperature in December is only about four degrees cooler than in June, and the max temperatures are only two degrees off. What might make December less successful, however, is that its minimum temperature of 56 is much colder than June's lowest of 64. December's larger range of temperatures will likely mean fewer visitors to the shop on colder days

Queries on precipitation and wind/severe weather would also be needed to determine how successful the shop would do in June and December.
